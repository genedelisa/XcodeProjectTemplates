Some simple Xcode project templates with files I always include. One template
for iOS and another for Cocoa.

I was especially annoyed by how hard it is to create "hidden" files that begin
with a . in Xcode, so here are templates that create them for you.

* .gitignore
* .travis.yml
* README.md
* LICENSE
* Credits.html for Cocoa projects

You can easily find these file templates and modify them to your taste. They use
the template placeholders so some things are already customized for you.

I originally wanted them to be in no group, i.e. at the project level. No such
luck doing that. (do you know how?) So, they (except Credits.html) will be in a group named Supporting Files.

Run the install.sh script or copy manually if you don't like being bashed.

The script will install them to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Project\ Templates/FolderNameYouSpecifyOnTheCommandLine
